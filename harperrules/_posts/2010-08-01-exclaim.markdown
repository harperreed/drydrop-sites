Excla.im is a jabber bot that allows you to update your twitter status very simply. All you need to get started is a jabber account (google talk will work as well) and a twitter account. Log in with your google account to associate the two.

Excla.im was built in two parts. The first was the Google App Engine app to control account information and access. The second is a python jabber bot that uses an API exposed by the GAE app.
