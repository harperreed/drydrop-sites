<div class="new_headline"><small>[October 24, 2003 08:32 PM]</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Well crap, we're sorry.</b></div>
<div id="body">
 Yesterday afternoon, Harper was taking a backhoe to his property to lay the foundation for his new guest house.  Sure enough, he forgot to check with our own ordinances on checking with our local Solar Development Committee in reference to safe sun spots to dig.  And now look, coronal mass ejection.  Half of the sun is currently without water, some of Harper's property and that of mine (Scott) which borders his was ejected into space, and our phones are lighting up with complaints.  Please direct all complaints to Harper.  I hear his little "mishap" could cause animals to go on cell phone stealing rampages, smashing them to pieces, but not before using all of your minutes.

<div class="new_headline"><small>[October 23, 2003 11:23 PM]</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Partnership</b></div>
<div id="body">
We have tentatively established a partnership with fashion designer <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jeremy+scott">Jeremy Scott</a>.  Working with him will be wonderful.

We have also hooked up with super group "The Virgin Tears" to help sell the sun. Look for a We Own the Sun song coming your way soon.

Things are happening.. !! more later!!!

<div class="new_headline"><small>[October 22, 2003 06:18 PM]</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>We are a responsible business</b></div>
<div id="body">
In this era of irresponsible business practices, we have decided to buck the trend and donate most of our profits to the American Cancer Society. This unprecedented move came after we realized that we own more land than ANYONE else - and can probably spare a few dollars. So buy some land and watch your dollars help those affected by cancer.
